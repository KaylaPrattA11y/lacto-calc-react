# Lacto-fermentation calculator tool - Astro/React version
This is a **work in progress**.

## About Lacto-fermentation
Lacto-fermentation is an ancient, anaerobic preservation method using salt and beneficial Lactobacillus bacteria to convert sugars in food into lactic acid. This process lowers pH, creating a tangy flavor while inhibiting harmful bacteria. It increases nutrients, digestibility, and pro-biotic levels in vegetables, dairy, and fruits. 

## Purpose of this tool
This tool allows quick and accurate calculations of salt/food/water ratios for safe fermentation. Each ferment attempt can be logged to a searchable, filterable table for easy retrieval.

Users of this tool can assess each attempt and measure the level of success. This data can be useful when fine-tuning the perfect pickle or hot sauce ferment.
